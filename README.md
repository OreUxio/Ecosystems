# Ecosystems

for orestes: I added what's called an interface in C#, which is a type of class. You can look up what it is in detail, but essentially it's a list of functions that you have to implement if you want to inherit the class. Inheriting means that you take all the properties of a class and build on top of it. If you inherit from the interface class, it means that I can plug your implementation straight into my game and it should work as if it was mine.

If you're not a programmer this is probably hard to understand, but I can explain it to you in more detail in person.
